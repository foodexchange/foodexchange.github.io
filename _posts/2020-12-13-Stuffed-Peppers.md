title: Stuffed Peppers and Zucchini
category: [vegetables, vegetarian]
---

This is especially good when you have a lot of late summer vegetables like zucchini and peppers. It's good hot or cold and also freezes well.

**Ingredients:**
- 8 bell peppers, or 8 zucchini, or a mix of the two
- 1 onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped fine
- 2 cups cooked rice, quinoa, bulgur, couscous, or other grain
- 1/2 cup raisins
- 1/2 cup walnuts, chopped
- a handful of herbs, your choice (parsley, mint, chives, basil, cilantro, whatever you have), chopped
- 4 tomatoes or a can of tomatoes, chopped
- salt, pepper, a bit of chili pepper, ground coriander seed, ground cumin seed
- grated cheese, optional
- olive oil

**Instructions:**
Preheat the oven to 375Ëš.

Cut bell peppers lengthwise into two boat-shaped halves, and remove the stem and seeds. If you're using zucchini, cut them in half lengthwise, and with a sharp knife hollow out the middles to leave a shell, and keep the middle part to add to the filling. Lightly salt the peppers and/or zucchini and set them aside while you make the filling.

In a large skillet, saute the onions in olive oil till soft and golden. If you're using zucchini, chop the middles into small dice and cook them with the onions. Then add the garlic, raisins, walnuts, and  herbs and stir to combine. Add salt, pepper, a bit of chili pepper, and a sprinkle of ground cumin and ground coriander. If you have an Italian or middle Easter spice mix that you like, you could use that instead. Mix the cooked grains in with the onion mixture. 

In a baking pan large enough to hold all of the vegetables, scatter the chopped tomatoes, and nestle in the peppers and/or zucchini. They should be pretty close together (they will get a bit smaller as they cook so it's OK to jam them in tightly). Distribute the filling mixture among the vegetables. 

Drizzle the tops generously with olive oil and sprinkle with grated cheese if you're using it.

Cover the pan with foil and bake for about 30-40 minutes, until the vegetable shells are tender. Then remove the foil and bake for another 10-15 minutes, until the tops are a bit golden.
