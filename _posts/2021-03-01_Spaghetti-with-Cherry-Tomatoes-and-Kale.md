This is a super fast, easy, delicious recipe from the New York Times supplement featuring “One Pot Cooking.” We’ve gotten tons of mileage out of it. The boiling water is used to make a sauce for the pasta.

**Ingredients:**
- 1 lb spaghetti
- 1 lb cherry tomatoes, halved (2 pints)
- 2 zested lemons
- ¼ cup plus 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt or to taste
- 1 bunch kale or spinach, leaves only, washed/chopped
- Black pepper
- Parmesan

Time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

Instructions:

# Boil exactly a quart of water. 

# Meanwhile, place spaghetti, tomatoes, lemon zest, oil, and 2 teaspoons kosher salt in a large, dry, shallow pan (large enough so spaghetti can lie flat).

# Add boiling water to pan with spaghetti. Cover pan and bring up to a boil. Remove lid and simmer for about 6 minutes, using tongues to move around spaghetti so it doesn’t stick. Add kale or spinach and continue cooking until remaining liquid has reduced to a sauce and pasta is cooked through.

# Taste, season with salt and pepper, and top with Parmesan.
